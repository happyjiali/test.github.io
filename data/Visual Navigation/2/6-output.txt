To navigate from 🏠 to 🏢, we need to find the path that avoids obstacles and leads to the destination. Let's break down the steps:

1. From 🏠, move left to the end of the continuous road.
2. From there, move down to the end of the continuous road.
3. Finally, move left to reach 🏢.

Let's visualize each step:

The 🏢 is now reached, and the navigation task is complete.
