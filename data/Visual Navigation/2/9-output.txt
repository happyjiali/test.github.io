To navigate from 🏠 to 🏢, we need to find the path that avoids the obstacles (🚧) and uses the roads (⬜). Let's start by moving from the home and making decisions at each step.

Initial map:
```

Step 1: Move down from 🏠 to the end of the continuous road.
```

Step 2: Move right from the current position to the end of the continuous road.

Step 3: Move up from the current position to the end of the continuous road, which is the destination 🏢.
