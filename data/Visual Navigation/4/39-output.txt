To navigate from 🏠 to 🏢, we need to find the path that avoids the obstacles (🚧) and follows the roads (⬜). Let's start by moving from the home and making decisions at each step.

1. Move down from 🏠 to the first ⬜ (since moving right is blocked by 🚧).
```

2. Move down again to the next ⬜ (continuing straight down).

3. Move right to the end of the continuous road (since moving down is blocked by 🚧).
```

4. Move down to the next ⬜ (continuing straight down).

5. Move left to the end of the continuous road (since moving down is blocked by 🚧).

6. Move down to 🏢 (the destination).

```

The steps to navigate to 🏢 are:
- Start at 🏠
- Move down 1 step
- Move down 1 step
- Move right 2 steps
- Move down 1 step
- Move left 2 steps
- Move down 1 step to reach 🏢

The visualization doesn't change with each step because the map is static and doesn't update with our movements. However, the instructions above will guide you from 🏠 to 🏢 while avoiding all obstacles.
